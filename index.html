    <h1>The Secret to Being a Top Developer Is Building Things!</h1>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/d/develope.htm">
      A developer is an individual who is responsible for creating or working on
      the development of a product or service. Most developers utilize one or
      more programming languages to develop their product or service.<br />
      They may work alone or on a team, and may develop part of or all a product
      or service.<br />
      For example, a software developer is an individual that may create a new
      software program or maintain an existing software program.<br />
      A web developer is an individual that creates or updates web pages,
      utilizing HTML, JavaScript, or other web programming languages.

      <p>
        For me, a developer is a person whose job is to solve problems, all kinds
        of problems.<br />
        And to solve problems you need 2 things :<br />
        <p id="first">Creativity</p>
        <p id="second">Skills</p>
      </p>
      <p>To be creative you have to think "outside of the box", or even better, get rid of the f*****g box iself !</p>
      <p>But it takes time and a lot of work to be skilled, and sometimes along the way you might feel discouraged.</p>
      <p>That's why there is another thing you need, almost as important if not more than creativity and skill :</p>
      <p id="third">Fun !</p>
      <p>Cause in the end, <b>Fun</b> is what will keep you goin' folks !</p>
      <p>As a conclusion, be <b>creative</b>, work on your <b>skills</b> and keep it <b>fun</b> !</p>
      <p>
        And remember : "No pain, no gain"
